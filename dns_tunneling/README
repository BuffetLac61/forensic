# This exercise aims at decoding the data packets extracted by a hypothetical attacker using a DNS tunnel
The dns packets were captured by wireshark in a pcap file
The useful payloads hidden behind these dns packets were filtred out using a simple strings command on the pcap file
The code extract and decode (base64) the packets and reveal a private SSH key was extracted
